git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "msg"

how to unstage any file ?
	git restore --staged first_renamed.txt

what if we modified any file and we think that was a mistake and 
want previous file?
	git checkout -- filename

we modified multiple files and want that previous unmodified status?
	git checkout -f
